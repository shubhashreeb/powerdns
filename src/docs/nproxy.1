.TH "NPROXY" "1" "Jul 22, 2021" "" "PowerDNS Authoritative Server"
.SH NAME
nproxy \- DNS notification proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnproxy\fP \-\-powerdns\-address \fIADDRESS\fP [\fIOPTION\fP]... \fIADDRESS\fP\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnproxy\fP is a simple daemon that reads DNS NOTIFY queries on one
address and forwards them to an \(aqinner\(aq nameserver that will process the
notification.
.sp
Its usecase is e.g. a private authoritative server inside a NAT or
firewalled LAN where \fBnproxy\fP is deployed in the DMZ.
.sp
The PowerDNS Authoritative Server has the trusted\-notification\-proxy
option that should be set to the address set with \fI\-\-origin\-address\fP to
accept these proxied notifications.
.sp
\fBnproxy\fP also has a health\-check option built in. A query for
\(aqpdns.nproxy.\(aq with QType \(aqTXT\(aq will be responded to with an answer of
"OK" (inside the TXT record. When the query is for an A\-record,
\(aq1.2.3.4.\(aq is returned.
