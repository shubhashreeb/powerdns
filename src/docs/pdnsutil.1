.TH "PDNSUTIL" "1" "Jul 22, 2021" "" "PowerDNS Authoritative Server"
.SH NAME
pdnsutil \- PowerDNS record and DNSSEC command and control
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
pdnsutil [OPTION]... \fICOMMAND\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBpdnsutil\fP (formerly pdnssec) is a powerful command that is the
operator\-friendly gateway into DNSSEC and zone management for PowerDNS.
Behind the scenes, \fBpdnsutil\fP manipulates a PowerDNS backend database,
which also means that for many databases, \fBpdnsutil\fP can be run
remotely, and can configure key material on different servers.

.B activate\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Activate a key with id \fIKEY\-ID\fP within a zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
add\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP [\fBKSK\fP,\fBZSK\fP] [\fBactive\fP,\fBinactive\fP] [\fBpublished\fP,\fBunpublished\fP] \fIKEYBITS\fP \fIALGORITHM\fP
Create a new key for zone \fIZONE\fP, and make it a KSK or a ZSK (default), with
the specified algorithm. The key is inactive by default, set it to
\fBactive\fP to immediately use it to sign \fIZONE\fP\&. The key is published
in the zone by default, set it to \fBunpublished\fP to keep it from
being returned in a DNSKEY query, which is useful for algorithm
rollovers. Prints the id of the added key.
.TP
.B create\-bind\-db \fIFILE\fP
Create DNSSEC database (sqlite3) at \fIFILE\fP for the BIND backend.
Remember to set \fBbind\-dnssec\-db=*FILE*\fP in your \fBpdns.conf\fP\&.
.TP
.B deactivate\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Deactivate a key with id KEY\-ID within a zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B disable\-dnssec \fIZONE\fP
Deactivate all keys and unset PRESIGNED in \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B export\-zone\-dnskey \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Export to standard output DNSKEY and DS of key with key id \fIKEY\-ID\fP
within zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B export\-zone\-ds \fIZONE\fP
Export to standard output all KSK DS records for \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B export\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Export to standard output full (private) key with key id \fIKEY\-ID\fP
within zone called \fIZONE\fP\&. The format used is compatible with BIND
and NSD/LDNS.
.TP
generate\-zone\-key {\fBKSK\fP,\fBZSK\fP} [\fIALGORITHM\fP] [\fIKEYBITS\fP]
Generate a ZSK or KSK to stdout with specified algorithm and bits
and print it on STDOUT. If \fIALGORITHM\fP is not set, ECDSA256 is
used. If \fIKEYBITS\fP is not set, an appropriate keysize is selected
for \fIALGORITHM\fP\&. Each ECC\-based algorithm supports only one valid
\fIKEYBITS\fP value: For ECDSA256 and ED25519, it is 256; for ECDSA384,
it is 384; and for ED448, it is 456.
.TP
import\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIFILE\fP {\fBKSK\fP,\fBZSK\fP}
Import from \fIFILE\fP a full (private) key for zone called \fIZONE\fP\&. The
format used is compatible with BIND and NSD/LDNS. \fBKSK\fP or \fBZSK\fP
specifies the flags this key should have on import. Prints the id of
the added key.
.TP
.B publish\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Publish the key with id \fIKEY\-ID\fP within a zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B remove\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Remove a key with id \fIKEY\-ID\fP from a zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
set\-nsec3 \fIZONE\fP [\(aq\fIHASH\-ALGORITHM\fP \fIFLAGS\fP \fIITERATIONS\fP \fISALT\fP\(aq] [\fBnarrow\fP]
Sets NSEC3 parameters for this zone. The quoted parameters are 4
values that are used for the the NSEC3PARAM record and decide how
NSEC3 records are created. The NSEC3 parameters must be quoted on
the command line. \fIHASH\-ALGORITHM\fP must be 1 (SHA\-1). Setting
\fIFLAGS\fP to 1 enables NSEC3 opt\-out operation. Only do this if you
know you need it. For \fIITERATIONS\fP, please consult RFC 5155, section
10.3. And be aware that a high number might overload validating
resolvers and that a limit can be set with \fBmax\-nsec3\-iterations\fP
in \fBpdns.conf\fP\&. The \fISALT\fP is a hexadecimal string encoding the bits
for the salt, or \- to use no salt. Setting \fBnarrow\fP will make PowerDNS
send out "white lies" (RFC 7129) about the next secure record to
prevent zone enumeration. Instead of looking it up in the database,
it will send out the hash + 1 as the next secure record. Narrow mode
requires online signing capabilities by the nameserver and therefore
zone transfers are denied. If only the zone is provided as argument,
the 4\-parameter quoted string defaults to \fB\(aq1 0 1 ab\(aq\fP\&. A sample
commandline is: \fBpdnsutil set\-nsec3 powerdnssec.org \(aq1 1 1 ab\(aq narrow\fP\&.
\fBWARNING\fP: If running in RSASHA1 mode (algorithm 5 or 7), switching
from NSEC to NSEC3 will require a DS update in the parent zone.
.TP
.B unpublish\-zone\-key \fIZONE\fP \fIKEY\-ID\fP
Unpublish the key with id \fIKEY\-ID\fP within a zone called \fIZONE\fP\&.
.TP
.B unset\-nsec3 \fIZONE\fP
Converts \fIZONE\fP to NSEC operations. \fBWARNING\fP: If running in
RSASHA1 mode (algorithm 5 or 7), switching from NSEC to NSEC3 will
require a DS update at the parent zone!
.TP
.B set\-publish\-cds \fIZONE\fP [\fIDIGESTALGOS\fP]
Set \fIZONE\fP to respond to queries for its CDS records. the optional
argument \fIDIGESTALGOS\fP should be a comma\-separated list of DS
algorithms to use. By default, this is 2 (SHA\-256). 0 will publish a
CDS with a DNSSEC delete algorithm.
.TP
set\-publish\-cdnskey \fIZONE\fP [\fBdelete\fP]
Set \fIZONE\fP to publish CDNSKEY records. Add \(aqdelete\(aq to publish a CDNSKEY
with a DNSSEC delete algorithm.
.TP
.B unset\-publish\-cds \fIZONE\fP
Set \fIZONE\fP to stop responding to queries for its CDS records.
.TP
.B unset\-publish\-cdnskey \fIZONE\fP
Set \fIZONE\fP to stop publishing CDNSKEY records.
